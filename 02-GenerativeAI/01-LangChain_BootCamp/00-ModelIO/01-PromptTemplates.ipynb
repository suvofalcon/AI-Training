    "\n",
    "Chat models require a list of chat messages called a prompt, which is different from a raw string that you would input into a language model. Each message in the prompt is associated with a role, such as AI, human, or system.\n",
    "For instance, when using the OpenAI Chat Completion API, a chat message can be assigned the role of AI, human, or system. The model is designed to pay closer attention to instructions provided in system chat messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify the process of constructing and working with prompts, LangChain offers various prompt templates. It is highly recommended to utilize these chat-related prompt templates instead of PromptTemplate when interacting with chat models. This will allow you to fully harness the potential of the underlying chat model and enhance your experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will favor these models in the course due to upcoming changes in the OpenAI ecosystem where chat agents will be favored over text completion models."
